## Project Overview
The project entails a web-based application designed for users to oversee a collection of books and bookstores. The books and bookstores are stored in a MySQL database and can be viewed and modified through a user-friendly Angular interface. The backend operations and communication with the database are managed by the Spring Boot framework. Books can be associated with one or more bookstores, or they can exist without any specific affiliation. The relationship between bookstores and books is defined as many-to-many.

## Features
The web application offers the following features:

**Book Management:** Users can perform CRUD operations on the collection of books, including creating new books, viewing existing books, updating book details, and deleting books. \n
**Bookshop Management:** Users can perform CRUD operations on the collection of bookshops, including creating new booksshop, viewing existing bookshops, updating bookshop details, adding or removing books from bookshops and deleting bookshops.
**Responsive Design:** The frontend interface is designed to provide a seamless user experience.

## Technology Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies:

**Spring Boot:** A Java-based framework for building backend applications. It provides a robust foundation for developing RESTful APIs and managing application configuration.
**Angular:** A popular TypeScript-based frontend framework used for building dynamic single-page applications. It provides a modular structure and powerful tools for UI development.
**MySQL:** An open-source relational database management system that stores and retrieves data for the application. It offers reliable data persistence and efficient data querying.
